# Hopelessly Useless Due to the Circumstances of Floating in the Universe

An open-ended experiment with WebGL with a simple theme: "a sad person floating in space".

## How project is organized

Now that the majority of ES6 syntax is supported in evergreen browsers, I want to keep this project simple and focused. No build tools and split the code up into classes. Classes that can be previewed with their respective html page (see the classes directory) and developed in isolation.
